## Introduction

Evolutionary algorithms mimic the process of natural selection to solve complex optimization problems. They use mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. This project aims to provide a robust framework for implementing and experimenting with these algorithms.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily add or modify components.
- **Support for LLMs**: Integrate large language models for enhanced functionality.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands for executing algorithms.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples.
- **Community-Driven**: Open for contributions and feedback.

## Getting Started

To get started with Evolve, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all necessary libraries installed.
3. **Run the Examples**: Explore the provided examples to understand the capabilities of the framework.

## Installation

To install Evolve, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scantyragna/evolve.git
   cd evolve
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` for Python packages:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/scantyragna/evolve/releases). Look for the file you need to download and execute.

## Usage

Once you have installed Evolve, you can start using it for your projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement an evolutionary algorithm:

```python
from evolve import EvolutionaryAlgorithm

# Initialize the algorithm
ea = EvolutionaryAlgorithm()

# Define your problem
ea.set_problem(your_problem)

# Run the algorithm
results = ea.run()

# Output the results
print(results)
```

For more examples and detailed usage, check the documentation.
